     Add support for an experimental zero-knowledge password authentication
     method using the J-PAKE protocol described in F. Hao, P. Ryan,
     "Password Authenticated Key Exchange by Juggling", 16th Workshop on
     Security Protocols, Cambridge, April 2008.
     
     This method allows password-based authentication without exposing
     the password to the server. Instead, the client and server exchange
     cryptographic proofs to demonstrate of knowledge of the password while
     revealing nothing useful to an attacker or compromised endpoint.
     
     This is experimental, work-in-progress code and is presently
     compiled-time disabled (turn on -DJPAKE in Makefile.inc).

     would always allow one try (for "none" auth).
     Preincrement failure count before post-auth test - previously this
     checked and postincremented, also to allow one "none" try.
     Together, these two changes always count the "none" auth method
     which could be skipped by a malicious client (e.g. an SSH worm)
     to get an extra attempt at a real auth method. They also make
     MaxAuthTries=0 a useful way to block users entirely (esp. in a
     sshd_config Match block).
     Also, move sending of any preauth banner from "none" auth method
     to the first call to input_userauth_request(), so worms that skip
     the "none" method get to see it too.

     Introduce SSH Fingerprint ASCII Visualization, a technique inspired by the
     graphical hash visualization schemes known as "random art", and by
     Dan Kaminsky's musings on the subject during a BlackOp talk at the
     23C3 in Berlin.
     Scientific publication (original paper):
     "Hash Visualization: a New Technique to improve Real-World Security",
     Perrig A. and Song D., 1999, International Workshop on Cryptographic
     Techniques and E-Commerce (CrypTEC '99)
     http://sparrow.ece.cmu.edu/~adrian/projects/validation/validation.pdf
     The algorithm used here is a worm crawling over a discrete plane,
     leaving a trace (augmenting the field) everywhere it goes.
     Movement is taken from dgst_raw 2bit-wise.  Bumping into walls
     makes the respective movement vector be ignored for this turn,
     thus switching to the other color of the chessboard.
     Graphs are not unambiguous for now, because circles in graphs can be
     walked in either direction.

     #859, patch from YOSHIFUJI Hideaki and John Devitofranceschi.  ok
     deraadt@ djm@
     djm belives that the reason for the "0" strings is to ensure that
     it's not possible to call getaddrinfo with both host and port being
     NULL.  In the case of canohost.c host is a local array.  In the
     case of sshconnect.c, it's checked for null immediately before use.
     In dns.c it ultimately comes from ssh.c:main() and is guaranteed to
     be non-null but it's not obvious, so I added a warning message in
     case it is ever passed a null.

     simply increasing the number of allows multiplexed sessions.
     Because some bozos are sure to configure MaxSessions in excess of the
     number of available file descriptors in sshd (which, at peak, might be
     as many as 9*MaxSessions), audit sshd to ensure that it doesn't leak fds

     the server (bz #1384)
