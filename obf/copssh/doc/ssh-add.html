<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>ssh-add</B>


adds RSA or DSA identities to the authentication agent,
ssh-agent1.


When run without arguments, it adds the files
~/.ssh/id_rsa

 
~/.ssh/id_dsa

and
~/.ssh/identity

 
After loading a private key,
<B>ssh-add</B>


will try to load corresponding certificate information from the
filename obtained by appending
-cert.pub

to the name of the private key file.
Alternative file names can be given on the command line.
<P>

If any file requires a passphrase,
<B>ssh-add</B>


asks for the passphrase from the user.
The passphrase is read from the user's tty.
<B>ssh-add</B>


retries the last passphrase if multiple identity files are given.
<P>

The authentication agent must be running and the
<B>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</B>

environment variable must contain the name of its socket for
<B>ssh-add</B>


to work.
<P>

The options are as follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>-c</B>


<DD>
Indicates that added identities should be subject to confirmation before
being used for authentication.
Confirmation is performed by the
<B>SSH_ASKPASS</B>

program mentioned below.
Successful confirmation is signaled by a zero exit status from the
<B>SSH_ASKPASS</B>

program, rather than text entered into the requester.
<DT><B>-D</B>


<DD>
Deletes all identities from the agent.
<DT><B>-d</B>


<DD>
Instead of adding identities, removes identities from the agent.
If
<B>ssh-add</B>


has been run without arguments, the keys for the default identities will
be removed.
Otherwise, the argument list will be interpreted as a list of paths to
public key files and matching keys will be removed from the agent.
If no public key is found at a given path,
<B>ssh-add</B>


will append
.pub

and retry.
<DT><B>-e </B><I>pkcs11</I>




<DD>
Remove keys provided by the PKCS#11 shared library
<I>pkcs11</I>

 
<DT><B>-L</B>


<DD>
Lists public key parameters of all identities currently represented
by the agent.
<DT><B>-l</B>


<DD>
Lists fingerprints of all identities currently represented by the agent.
<DT><B>-s </B><I>pkcs11</I>




<DD>
Add keys provided by the PKCS#11 shared library
<I>pkcs11</I>

 
<DT><B>-t </B><I>life</I>




<DD>
Set a maximum lifetime when adding identities to an agent.
The lifetime may be specified in seconds or in a time format
specified in
sshd_config5.


<DT><B>-X</B>


<DD>
Unlock the agent.
<DT><B>-x</B>


<DD>
Lock the agent with a password.
</DL>

<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>DISPLAY and SSH_ASKPASS</B>


<DD>
If
<B>ssh-add</B>


needs a passphrase, it will read the passphrase from the current
terminal if it was run from a terminal.
If
<B>ssh-add</B>


does not have a terminal associated with it but
<B>DISPLAY</B>

and
<B>SSH_ASKPASS</B>

are set, it will execute the program specified by
<B>SSH_ASKPASS</B>

and open an X11 window to read the passphrase.
This is particularly useful when calling
<B>ssh-add</B>


from a
.xsession

or related script.
(Note that on some machines it
may be necessary to redirect the input from
/dev/null

to make this work.)
<DT><B>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</B>


<DD>
Identifies the path of a
UNIX
socket used to communicate with the agent.
</DL>
<P>

<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FILES</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>~/.ssh/identity

</B>
<DD>
Contains the protocol version 1 RSA authentication identity of the user.
<DT><B>~/.ssh/id_dsa

</B>
<DD>
Contains the protocol version 2 DSA authentication identity of the user.
<DT><B>~/.ssh/id_rsa

</B>
<DD>
Contains the protocol version 2 RSA authentication identity of the user.
</DL>
<P>

<P>

Identity files should not be readable by anyone but the user.
Note that
<B>ssh-add</B>


ignores identity files if they are accessible by others.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DIAGNOSTICS</H2>

Exit status is 0 on success, 1 if the specified command fails,
and 2 if
<B>ssh-add</B>


is unable to contact the authentication agent.

<H2>AUTHORS</H2>

OpenSSH is a derivative of the original and free
ssh 1.2.12 release by Tatu Ylonen.
Aaron Campbell, Bob Beck, Markus Friedl, Niels Provos,
Theo de Raadt and Dug Song

created OpenSSH.
Markus Friedl contributed the support for SSH
protocol versions 1.5 and 2.0.
